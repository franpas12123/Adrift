# Adrift
\
A simple (4x4) maze game. The objective is to get the cookie in the "Multi-Terain Training Fields."\
Beware! The maze consists of "teleporters" which changes the map. The cookie is still there but the path to the cookie changes!\
Remember the area/tile in which the map changes. It is where the "teleporter" of that map is located. Enjoy!\
