Open "Adrift in Swapping Sections.jar" to run the game.

Controls: 
	W - Move up
	A - Move left
	S - Move down
	D - Move right

NOTE:\
	[1] Never edit Level-1.txt, Level-2.txt, Level-3.txt, Level-4.txt, Level-5.txt. Editing this CAN crash the game.\
	\
	[2] Just in case you will never follow [1]:\
			"0" - teleporters\
			"1" - path\

	\
	[2] Show map name in console, go to "Maze.java" and uncomment line 296. Play the game. Every time you move, the map name will be displayed.\
	\
	[3] To show paths and teleporters, CUT "res" folder somewhere safe (NOTE: this will prevent the app from loading images. Be sure to return it back. If not, go to "backup" folder, COPY "res" folder and PASTE it OUTSIDE "backup" folder)\
	\

		"Level-1.txt"\
		"Level-2.txt"\
		"Level-3.txt"\
		"Level-4.txt"\
		"Level-5.txt"\
		and PASTE it outside "backup" folder. If the OS asks to replace/overwrite files, click ok. Run "Adrift in Swapping Sections.jar" again.\
